Turn around, look at what you see
In her face, the mirror of your dream
Make believe, I'm everywhere
Given in the light
Written on the pages is
<strong>The answer to our <u>never ending story</u></strong>, ah
Reach the starts, fly a fantasy
Dream a dream, and what you see, will be
Rhymes that keep their secrets will
Unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow is
The answer to our never ending story, ah
Story, ah</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">You just saved the world
Gosh, I miss you Dusty Bun
I miss you more, Suzie Poo
I miss you more, multiplied by all the start in our galaxy
No, I miss you-
Enough</p>
